Table Querying without using SQL using TAPAS: A weakly supervised transformer for nlp

Inference from tabular data generally used to require knowledge of data manipulation using SQL or noSQL based technologies; but now with TAPAS, users can query for what they want in natural language. In this project, we have put together a working prototype from a model, which can be monetized and sold to companies with product listings, real estate listings, companies/schools/universities with course information - those companies can incorporate our tool into a chatbot in their website.
